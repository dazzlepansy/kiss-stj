# kiss-stj

A KISS Linux repository for packages I use on my systems.

Packages are provided for reference and with no guarantees. Wherever a
`configure` script is called, I've also included a $KISS_CONFIGURE variable
that allows people to hook into the configure process without changing the
packaging scripts, e.g. when cross-compiling.

## Known Issues

I expect some of the dependencies aren't listed because they were already
installed on my system. I also haven't been 100% clear on differentiating
build from runtime dependencies. That said, if something doesn't build then
the dependency should be available from the community repo so you can just
install it and try again.
